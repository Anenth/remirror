# Installation

Rather than installing multiple scoped packages, the `remirror` package is a gateway to using all
the goodness that remirror provides while minimising your bundle size.

Use the installation instruction outlined below, depending on the package manager used in your
project.

```bash
# yarn
yarn add remirror @remirror/pm

# pnpm
pnpm add remirror @remirror/pm

# npm
npm install remirror @remirror/pm
```

You will also notice that you are also installing `@remirror/pm`. This is a peer dependency to all
the scoped `@remirror` packages which interact with prosemirror. It provides some assurances around
the versions of prosemirror libraries being used and helps simplify the codebase.

## Usage

Once installed you will be able to add the following code which creates an editor with the bold
extension active. Clicking the button when text is selected will toggle between bold and not bold.

```tsx live=true
import React, { useCallback } from 'react';
import { BoldExtension } from 'remirror/extension/bold';
import { ReactProvider, useManager, useRemirror, useExtensionCreator } from 'remirror/react';

const Editor = () => {
  const { getRootProps, active, commands } = useRemirror();

  const toggleBold = useCallback(() => {
    commands.toggleBold();
  }, [commands]);

  return (
    <div>
      <div {...getRootProps()} />
      <button onClick={toggleBold} style={{ fontWeight: active.bold() ? 'bold' : undefined }}>
        Bold
      </button>
    </div>
  );
};

const EditorWrapper = () => {
  const boldExtension = useExtensionCreator(BoldExtension);
  const manager = useManager([boldExtension]);

  return (
    <ReactProvider manager={manager}>
      <Editor />
    </ReactProvider>
  );
};
```

While a lot of the above code may not make much sense at the moment, keep reading the guide to
understand more.
