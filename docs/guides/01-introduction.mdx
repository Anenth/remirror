This documentation is still a work in progress. It is being updated in parallel with the `next`
branch could still be due some major changes.

While reading through this guide, if you find any errors or would like to suggest some improvements
you have several options.

- Open an issue in our [github repo](https://github.com/issues).
- Create a pull request with your proposed improvement (most pages have an edit button).
- Move on, because deadlines are looming and life is too short.

Whatever you decide I'm happy that you've taken the time to get to know the `remirror` project
better. I hope it proves to be worthy recipient of your time and attention.

## Target audience

This guide will have two audiences.

- Contributors / extension developers.
- Consumers of the library.

Regardless of where you stand, I have endeavoured to make it approachable and interesting for a
whole range of developers.

This guide assumes that you're familiar with JavaScript and have some understanding of `React`. If
you're brand new to programming or JavaScript I would encourage you to look into other resources
before attempting to read through this. Of course, I'm not here to stop you from doing what you
want. Joy is a wonderful commodity and if you find any comfort while reading this documentation,
then by all means, craft your own beautifully unique path.
