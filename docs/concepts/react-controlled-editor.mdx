title: React controlled editor

:::note Advanced Topic

The following is considered an advanced topic. If you are struggling to understand some of the
concepts don't feel bad. It can be hard to understand initially.

There are times when you will want complete control over the content in your editor. For this reason
remirror supports **controlled editors**. Setting up your editor like this is more complicated and
for this reason is marked as an advanced topic.

Get started in the usual way.

```tsx
import React from 'react';
import { RemirrorProvider, useRemirror, createReactManager } from 'remirror/react';
import { BoldExtension } from 'remirror/extension/bold';

const manager = createReactManager([new BoldExtension()]);

const EditorWrapper = () => {
  // This will be changed
  return (
    <RemirrorProvider manager={manager}>
      <Editor />
    </RemirrorProvider>
  );
};

const Editor = () => {
  const { getRootProps } = useRemirror();

  return <div {...getRootProps()} />;
};
```

The main difference is that you will need to create the state value that is passed into the editor.
This value is called the `EditorState` and is an object that will be familiar to you if you have
used `ProseMirror` in the past. When remirror sees the value it knows to treat the editor as a
controlled instance. For things to work correctly you are required to add an `onChange` handler for
the `RemirrorProvider`.

```tsx
// Add the `useState` hook to keep track of the state.
import React, { useState } from 'react';
import { RemirrorProvider, useRemirror, createReactManager } from 'remirror/react';
import { BoldExtension } from 'remirror/extension/bold';

// Add the `fromHtml` string handler import so that the initial state can be a html string.
import { fromHtml } from 'remirror/core';

const manager = createReactManager([new BoldExtension()]);

const EditorWrapper = () => {
  // Create the initial value for the manager.
  const initialValue = manager.createState({
    content: '<p>This is the initial value</p>',
    stringHandler: fromHtml,
  });

  const [value, setValue] = useState(initialValue);

  // Add the value and change handler to the editor.
  return (
    <RemirrorProvider
      manager={manager}
      value={value}
      onChange={(parameter) => {
        // Update the state to the latest value.
        setValue(parameter.state);
      }}
    >
      <Editor />
    </RemirrorProvider>
  );
};

const Editor = () => {
  const { getRootProps } = useRemirror();

  return <div {...getRootProps()} />;
};
```

The editor now behaves in a similar way to what you'd expect from a non controlled editor. The main
thing is that we've been able to intercept the state update and can do some pretty interesting
things with this power.

For example, the following change handler now intercepts the state update in order to insert `NO!!!`
into the editor whenever the user types any content.

```tsx
const EditorWrapper = () => {
  const initialValue = manager.createState({
    content: '<p>This is the initial value</p>',
    stringHandler: fromHtml,
  });

  const [value, setValue] = useState(initialValue);

  return (
    <RemirrorProvider
      manager={manager}
      value={value}
      onChange={(parameter) => {
        const { state, tr } = parameter;
        let nextState = state;

        // Check if the document content for the editor changed.
        if (tr?.docChanged) {
          // Insert text into the editor via a new state.
          const nextState = state.applyTransaction(state.tr.insertText('NO!!!'));
        }

        // Update to using a new value
        setValue(nextState);
      }}
    >
      <Editor />
    </RemirrorProvider>
  );
};
```
