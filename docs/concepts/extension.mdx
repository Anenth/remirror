title: Extension
---

Extensions manage similar concerns. It allows for grouping items that affect:

- How the editor displays certain content, i.e. **bold**, _italic_, <u>underline</u>.
- Makes certain commands available e.g. `commands.toggleBold()` to toggle the bold formatting of the
  currently selected text.
- Check if a command can be run for the current selection `commands.undo.isEnabled()`.
- Check if a mark is active at the current selection, `active.italic()`.
- Register ProseMirror plugins, keymaps, input rules, paste rules, and custom nodeViews, which
  affect the behaviour of the editor.

There are three types of `Extension`.

- `NodeExtension` - For creating [ProseMirror nodes](https://prosemirror.net/docs/ref/#model.Node)
  in the editor.
- `MarkExtension` - For creating [ProseMirror marks](https://prosemirror.net/docs/ref/#model.Mark)
  in the editor.
- `PlainExtension` - For behaviour which doesn't need to be displayed in the DOM.

## Lifecycle Methods

Extensions are able to completely customise the behaviour of the editor via these lifecycle methods.
Even core functionality like the creation of `Schema` is built via `Extensions`. This section
outlines what you're working with in extensions.

### `onCreate`

```ts
onCreate(extensions: readonly AnyExtension[]): void;
```

This handler is called when the `RemirrorManager` is first created. Since it is called as soon as
the manager is some methods may not be available in the extension store. When accessing methods on
`this.store` be shore to check when they become available in the lifecycle. It is recommende that
you don't use this method unless absolutely required.

### `onView`

```ts
onView( extensions: readonly AnyExtension[], view: EditorView<EditorSchema>): void
```

This event happens when the `EditorView` is first added by the ui layer. This is the lifecycle
method where commands and editor helpers are added.

### `onStateUpdate`

```ts
onStateUpdate(parameter: import('remirror/core').StateUpdateLifecycleParameter): void
```

This is called whenever a transaction successfully updates the `EditorState`. For controlled
component this is called whenever the state value is updated.

### `onDestroy`

```ts
onDestroy(extensions: readonly AnyExtension[]): void
```

This is called when the `RemirrorManager` is being destroyed.
