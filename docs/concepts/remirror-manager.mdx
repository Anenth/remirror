title: RemirrorManager
---

The `RemirrorManager` is responsible for grouping together the `Extension`'s and `Preset`'s and
providing their behaviour to your editor. It wraps the functionality by providing the following
lifecycyle methods which are used by the view layers to manger the editor at run time.

### `onCreate`

This is called when the `RemirrorManager` is first created.

:::note

In the previous version of `remirror` the `RemirrorManager` referred to a `React` component. That
was in the _before times_ of which we do not speak.
