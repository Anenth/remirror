## ExtensionManager class

A class to manage the extensions and prosemirror interactions of our editor.

<b>Signature:</b>

```typescript
export declare class ExtensionManager<GExtension extends AnyExtension = any> implements ExtensionManagerInitParams<SchemaFromExtensions<GExtension>> 
```

## Remarks

The extension manager has three phases of Initialization:

- Construction - This takes in all the extensions and creates the schema.

```ts
const manager = ExtensionManager.create([ new DocExtension(), new TextExtension(), new ParagraphExtension()])

```
- Initialize Getters - This connects the extension manager to the lazily evaluated `getState` method and the `portalContainer`<!-- -->. Once these are created and allows access to its data.

```ts
manager.init({ getState: () => state, portalContainer: new PortalContainer })

manager.data.

```
- Initialize View - This connects the extension manager to the EditorView and creates the actions (which need access to the view).

```ts
manager.initView(new EditorView(...))
manager.data.actions

```

## Constructors

|  Constructor | Modifiers | Description |
|  --- | --- | --- |
|  [(constructor)(extensions)](./core.extensionmanager._constructor_.md) |  | Creates the extension manager which is used to simplify the management the prosemirror editor.<!-- -->This should not be called directly if you want to use prioritized extensions. Instead use <code>ExtensionManager.create</code>. |

## Properties

|  Property | Modifiers | Type | Description |
|  --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  [extensions](./core.extensionmanager.extensions.md) |  | <code>GExtension[]</code> | The extensions stored by this manager |
|  [getState](./core.extensionmanager.getstate.md) |  | <code>() =&gt; EditorState</code> | Retrieve the latest state of the editor this manager is responsible for. This is only available after the first Initialization. |
|  [getTheme](./core.extensionmanager.gettheme.md) |  | <code>() =&gt; RemirrorThemeContextType</code> | Provides access to the theme and helpers from the RemirrorThemeContext |
|  [portalContainer](./core.extensionmanager.portalcontainer.md) |  | <code>PortalContainer</code> | Retrieve the portal container for any custom nodeViews. This is only available after the first Initialization. |

## Methods

|  Method | Modifiers | Description |
|  --- | --- | --- |
|  [create(prioritizedExtensions)](./core.extensionmanager.create.md) | <code>static</code> | A static method for creating a new extension manager. |
|  [createState({ content, doc, stringHandler, fallback })](./core.extensionmanager.createstate.md) |  | Create the editor state from content passed to this extension manager. |
|  [extensionData()](./core.extensionmanager.extensiondata.md) |  | Collect data from all the extensions. This will be made available to the consuming react component within the context data and also the child renderProp function parameters. |
|  [getPluginState(name)](./core.extensionmanager.getpluginstate.md) |  | Retrieve the state for a given extension name. This will throw an error if the extension doesn't exist. |
|  [init({ getState, portalContainer, getTheme })](./core.extensionmanager.init.md) |  | Initialize the extension manager with important data.<!-- -->This is called by the view layer and provides |
|  [initView(view)](./core.extensionmanager.initview.md) |  | Stores the editor view on the manager |
|  [isEqual(otherManager)](./core.extensionmanager.isequal.md) |  | Checks whether two manager's are equal. Can be used to determine whether a change in props has caused anything to actually change and prevent a rerender.<!-- -->ExtensionManagers are equal when - They have the same number of extensions - Same order of extensions - Each extension has the same options (ignoring methods) |
|  [onTransaction(params)](./core.extensionmanager.ontransaction.md) |  | A handler which allows the extension to respond to each transaction without needing to register a plugin.<!-- -->This is currently used in the collaboration plugin. |
|  [ssrTransformer(element)](./core.extensionmanager.ssrtransformer.md) |  | Adjusts the rendered element based on the extension transformers. |
