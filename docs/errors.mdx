This page contains the documented errors that occur while using `remirror`. Currently the
descriptions are very short and if you'd like to contribute to make them more comprehensive, then
that would be very much appreciated. Edit this page to get started.

## RMR0000

> Production Error

An error occurred in production and details are intentionally being hidden.

## RMR0001

> Unknown Error

Sooo, this is embarassing. Something happened and we're not quite sure why. Your best course of
action is to open an [issue](https://github.com/remirror/remirror/issues/new?template=bug_report.md)
explaining what you're seeing.

## RMR0002

> Invalid Command Arguments

The arguments passed to the command method were invalid. Check how you're calling all commands made
available by the editor and make sure arguments are correct.

## RMR0003

> Custom Error

This is a custom error possibly thrown by an external library. It's almost as hard to diagnose as
the `Unknown Error`.

## RMR0004

> Core Helpers

An error occurred in a function called from the `@remirror/core-helpers` library.

## RMR0005

> Mutation

You have attempted to change a value that shouldn't be changed.

## RMR0006

> Internal

This is an error which should not occur and is internal to the remirror codebase.

## RMR0007

> Missing Required Extension

You're editor is missing a required extension.

## RMR0008

within the scope of the returned functions. They should not be called in the outer scope of your
method.

## RMR0009

> New Editor Manager

No directly invoking the editor manager with `new`. Instead use one of the static methods to create
your instance.

## RMR0010

> Invalid Preset Extension

The user requested an invalid extension from the preset. Please check the `createExtensions` return
method is returning an extension with the defined constructor.

## RMR0011

> Invalid Manager Arguments

Invalid value passed into `Manager constructor`. Only `Presets` and `Extensions` are supported.

## RMR0012

> Commands Called In Outer Scope

The `commands` or `dispatch` method which is passed into the `create*` method should only be called
within returned method since it relies on an active view (not present in the outer scope).

## RMR0013

> Helpers Called In Outer Scope

The `helpers` method which is passed into the ``create\*` method should only be called within
returned method since it relies on an active view (not present in the outer scope).

The user requested an invalid extension from the manager.
